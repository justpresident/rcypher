# Implement a new extensible storage format that supports

## grouping secrets into folders
✅ **COMPLETED**
- Hierarchical folder structure with unlimited nesting depth
- Everything is in the root folder (/) by default
- Commands: `mkdir`, `cd`, `pwd` for folder navigation
- Full path support: `/work/projects/api_key`
- Relative paths: `../other_folder`, `./subfolder`
- Keys can be moved between folders using `mv` command
- Comprehensive test coverage for nested folders

## encryption domains
⚠️ **IN PROGRESS - Refactoring to unified structure**
- ✅ `FolderItem` enum with Secret/Folder/EncryptedFolder variants
- ✅ Unified `items` BTreeMap in Folder (no separate secrets/subfolders)
- ✅ Helper methods on FolderItem for ergonomic access
- Default encryption domain (0) uses the master key (same as storage v4)

⏳ **TODO: Simplified encryption approach**
- Non-default domains encrypt secrets/folders with a custom key requiring password
- Can be attached to individual secrets or entire folders
- Encrypted folders are VISIBLE as encrypted folders (no hiding with placeholder values)
- When locked: `get` returns "**LOCKED**" indicator
- When unlocked: folder becomes navigable, contents accessible
- "unlock {folder}" command asks for password, decrypts and populates in-memory
- "lock {folder}" command clears decrypted data from memory
- Delete operation works uniformly for secrets, folders, and encrypted folders

**Simplified Use Case**
Encryption:
- User calls "lock {folder/key}" which asks for encryption domain and password
- Content is immediately encrypted and stored encrypted
- Locked items show "**LOCKED**" when accessed

Decryption:
- "unlock {item}" asks for password
- Decrypts into memory, making content accessible
- Subsequent commands work normally on decrypted content

## move command
✅ **COMPLETED: move command**
- `mv SOURCE_PATTERN DESTINATION` - shell-like move behavior
- Single match: destination can be folder or full path (move+rename)
- Multiple matches: destination must be a folder
- Recursive pattern matching with regex support
- Preserves full key history during move
- Collision detection with pre-validation

⏳ **TODO: encryption domain support for move**
- Encrypted folders must be unlocked to allow moving/renaming keys from them
- Re-encryption should be performed with key from corresponding encryption domain when moving between domains

## support SecretType and optional metadata HashMap
⚠️ **PARTIALLY COMPLETED**
- Data structures exist: `SecretEntry` has `secret_type: SecretType` and `metadata: HashMap<String, String>` fields
- Currently only `SecretType::Utf8String` is implemented
- Metadata field exists but not exposed in CLI

⏳ **TODO**
- Add `SecretType::File` variant for file storage support
- Implement CLI commands to set/view metadata
- Add file upload/download functionality
- Support for binary data storage
